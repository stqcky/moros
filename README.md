An internal cheat for CS:2 built in Rust.
The experience was actually very enjoyable. A lot of ground work is required before building the actual cheat though.

Has a ton of interesting proc macro fuckery (such as dumping the schema, converting that to rust structs and then generating getters for fields).
I feel like this kind of fuckery allows to build better, more testable cheats. I don't believe this is possible using C++, in which most cheats are built.
